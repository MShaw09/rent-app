# RentWell App

# Objective

The objective of this assignment was to practice the fundementals of using servers to store and move data around using retrofit, glide, and other tools such as firebase. I also practiced prvious fundemental skills from the other apps such as jetpack navigation, intents, and UI design in xml format. All in all, the app allows users to sign in with their google accounts and make adverts about their apartment offers, with a place to view other adverts and make their own post. All of the data is stored on a server in a sqlite database which is communicated via the app to the user.
